The whole package includes:
(1)Three source codes named “Algorithm 1 Source Code.c”,”Algorithm 2 Source Code.c” and “Data generator.c” in the “Codes” folder.
(2)A report “Project1 report.pdf” in the “Documents” folder. 

Instructions:
(1)Open the report “Project1 report.pdf” and read.
(2)Open “Data generator.c” in your IDE.Change the const MAXN(N numbers),MAXM(M queries) and MAXV(Range of V) , compile and generate the data in the file “test.in” in the folder “output” with the executable file.
(3)Open “Algorithm 1 Source Code.c” in your IDE , compile and run(Or just run the Unix executable file “Algorithm 1 Source Code”).The output file named “testA1.out” will be in the folder “output” with the executable file.
(4)Open “Algorithm 2 Source Code.c” in your IDE , compile and run(Or just run the Unix executable file “Algorithm 2 Source Code”).The output file named “testA2.out” will be in the folder “output” with the executable file.
(5)Compare the duration of time between two algorithms in the file “testA1.out” and “testA2.out”.
